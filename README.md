# python-project-Car-Data
The car dataset contains information about various car attributes, such as make, model, year, price, mileage, and location.

The dataset includes cars from different manufacturers and models, allowing for detailed analysis and insights.

Key data analysis tasks may include exploring the distribution of car prices and identifying factors that influence pricing.

It is important to clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistent data types.

Descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, can be used to summarize numerical attributes like price and mileage.

Visualizations, such as histograms or box plots, can provide a visual representation of the distribution and spread of car prices or mileage.
